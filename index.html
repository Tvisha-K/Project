        <p>My hobby is reading books. Reading enhances our language skills and develops fluency, allowing us to express our thoughts and ideas better. Books quench our thirst for knowledge. Through books, we learn about how things work, understand different cultures, and comprehend the history of things. Reading books decreases our stress and it is also and aid to sleep.</p>
